# Design Pattern Examples

### What is Design Patterns? (Gang of Four)

The Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns are a set of 23 recurring solutions to common software design problems. These patterns were identified and documented in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (often referred to as the "Gang of Four" or simply "GoF"). The book, published in 1994, has become a seminal work in the field of software engineering and design.

* The GoF patterns are categorized into three groups based on their primary purpose:
  - __Creational Patterns:__ These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They abstract the instantiation process and hide the details of how objects are created, composed, and represented.
    - Examples: Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Singleton, Builder, Prototype.
   
  - __Structural Patterns:__ These patterns are concerned with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures. They focus on defining relationships between objects, ensuring they work together to achieve a larger goal.
    - Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.
  
  - __Behavioral Patterns:__ These patterns deal with communication between objects and the responsibilities that come with it. They describe not just patterns of objects or classes, but also patterns of communication between them.
    - Examples: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor.

Each pattern provides a standardized approach to solving specific design problems. By understanding and applying these patterns, software developers can create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable systems.

It's worth noting that while the GoF patterns are widely respected and used, not every pattern will be applicable to every situation. The choice of pattern depends on the problem you're trying to solve and the context of your software project.
